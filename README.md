# hello-world
## following the intro to GitHub tutorial

I am a self styled data scientist working in the non profit sector. So far, I have learned everything I know by playing with new tools, searching the internet for answers I can't figure out for myself, and leaning on my wife, who has a PhD in Information Science (that last trick comes in handy quite often)

**And I'm very happy to be working on a certificate from Johns-Hopkins via Coursera**
