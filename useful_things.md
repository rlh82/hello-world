#Useful Tools I Use

1. OneNote (fell in love after I was forced to migrate from Evernote)
2. Tableau (makes basic visualizations so much easier and faster)
3. Excel (hey, it's classic)
4. RStudio (eager to learn more)
5. GitBash (wading back into line command . . . and Linux, for that matter)
6. GitHub (no longer just a lurker!)

**and I'm sure there are more**
